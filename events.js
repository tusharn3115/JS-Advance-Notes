// events -------------------------------------------------------------
// Events are things that happen in the system you are programming â€” the system produces      (or "fires") a signal of some kind when an event occurs, and provides a mechanism by which an action can be automatically taken (that is, some code running) when the event occurs. 

// For example, if the user clicks a button on a webpage, you might want to react to that action by displaying an information box.
